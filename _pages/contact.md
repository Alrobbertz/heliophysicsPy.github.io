## Mailing List
There is a Google Groups mailing list for discussions open to anyone. To be added to the mailing list for this project, please do the following:<br />
1) Send an email to pyhc-list+subscribe@googlegroups.com. It doesn't have to have any subject/body text.  
2) Shortly thereafter (generally, less than a minute), you'll get a reply from the pyhc subscribe list. Just hit reply and send. Again, no subject/body text is required.  
3) Shortly thereafter again, you should receive an email saying you have joined the pyhc-list Google Group.  

Once you've joined, you will be able to send emails to the group via [pyhc-list@googlegroups.com](mailto: pyhc-list@googlegroups.com), from the email you used to join.<br />
If the above steps do not work for you, please contact Julie Barnum at LASP, [Julie.Barnum@lasp.colorado.edu](mailto:Julie.Barnum@lasp.colorado.edu)

## Chat room
For more informal discussions and questions there is a chat room to enable live chat between users and developers. The chat is hosted on matrix and clicking the following [link](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#heliopython:openastronomy.org) will open a browser window with the chat interface. There is no need to install any software.
