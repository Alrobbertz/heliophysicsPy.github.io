## Mailing List
There is a Google Groups mailing list for discussions. To be added to the mailing list for this project, please do the following:<br />
1) Ask to join the group at [this link](https://groups.google.com/group/pyhc-list/subscribe)<br />
2) You should receive a follow up email from doing Step 1. In that email, click 'Join This Group' to confirm your subscription. It should then send you back to the Google Groups page, with a message saying your email has been added to the groups.<br />

Once you've joined, you should be able to send emails to the group via [pyhc-list@googlegroups.com](mailto: pyhc-list@googlegroups.com)<br />
If the above steps do not work for you, please contact Julie Barnum at LASP, [Julie.Barnum@lasp.colorado.edu](mailto:Julie.Barnum@lasp.colorado.edu)
