**Meeting/Workshops**
* We held the Inaugural PyHC 2022 Summer School, which was a resounding success! 
    * The event took place in partnership with ESA, from Monday, May 30th, 2022 – Friday, June 3rd, 2022 at ESAC near Madrid, Spain. Around 500 people registered for the event, with about 50 in-person attendees and the rest virtually on the Zoom webinar (using the Slack space for communication). 
    * The Summer school taught some Python best practices and gave attendees hands-on instruction from our package experts as they take a deep dive — via tutorials, demos, and presentations — into the PyHC ecosystem. The event attracted mainly graduate students, early career scientists, and established scientists looking to transition to Python in Heliophysics/Space Weather. Most who attended were fairly new to Python (4 years or less experience).  
    * All Summer School project Jupyter notebooks can be found in the summer-school GitHub repo (https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/summer-school). 
* Began planning for the ninth-overall and sixth all-virtual PyHC Fall 2022 meeting. 
    * To be held Monday, Nov 7th - Thursday, Nov 10th (on Zoom, from 9 - 11 AM MT). 
    * Meeting content will follow past PyHC biannual meetings, with a combination of presentations, discussion sessions, and hackathon sessions. Meeting web page, etc., to come shortly. 
* The PyHC session abstracted, submitted to the Fall 2022 AGU meeting (https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting), was accepted.  
    * Session Title: Python Implementations in Solar and Space Physics 
    * We received 22 abstract submissions (the most of any PyHC AGU session!); this year will be a mix of oral presentations and an associated poster session. 
* Both the PyHC lead and technical lead presented at conferences on PyHC-related work (including the COSPAR 2022 and TESS meetings).

**Telecons/Website Updates**
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules allowed. 
    * Topics included some project introductions (PyThea, Feature Extraction Tools for Exploratory Analysis of Remote-Sensing Solar Observations (HDEE intro)), a Decadal Survey white paper revisit, as well discussions pertaining to PyHC communication and future PyHC summer schools. 
* Several more updates were made to the PyHC website during this quarter, as well: 
    * The meeting page now reflects the new PyHC AGU 2022 session. 
    * The Google calendar is displayed on the home page, as well as the meeting page. 
    * We purchased a new domain name! We are now findable at http://pyhc.org (currently redirects to heliopython.org). A very special thanks is owed to Pete Riley with Predictive Science Inc. for making the purchase and handling the renewals. 
    * Added Kamodo to core projects on the projects page 
    * Miscellaneous: added new members to people page and cleaned up the home page’s appearance.
