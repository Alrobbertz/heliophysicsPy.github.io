The [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io/) (BSSw) organization is now accepting 
applications to their [Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship). Applications are **due on October 15th**.

The goal of the BSSw Fellowship program "is to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer 
productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes". The bulk of the applications process is a proposal for 
a one-year funded activity that promotes development or use of better scientific software. This year's fellows' projects 
focus on best practices for developing research software, reducing technical debt in scientific software, debugging and 
improving reliability in scientific appllications, and understanding social challenges in the evolution of scientific 
software products. The award is $25,000; applicants must be affiliated with a US-based institution that is eligible to 
receive DoE funds.

BSSw aims to "address pressing challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability." 
It comprises multiple communities with connections to various fields of science and computing, with the over-arching 
goal of promoting awareness of good software practices in science.

Those who are not interested in applying to the fellowship program but who still want to consider contributing to BSSw 
can go [here](https://bssw.io/contributes/new).
