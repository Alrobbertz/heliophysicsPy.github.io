The Fall 2019 Meeting dates will be November 4th - 6th (MTW), where Monday and Tuesday will be full days, while Wednesday will likely be a half day. The location for this meeting is once more at LASP, specifically, in the LSTB building (Room A200 - note this is a different building/room than past meetings).

[This link](http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/) provides visitors to LASP with information on transportation to and from DIA, as well as around Boulder itself, helpful maps of the area, lodging, restaurants, etc.

Registration is required (so we can get a headcount for food) but free, and the website will be up soon (where you will register, among other things).
