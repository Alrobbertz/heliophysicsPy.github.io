title: "New Report Examines Reproducibility and Replicability in Science, Recommends Ways to Improve Transparency and Rigor in Research."

A new report by the National Academy of Sciences has issued new recommendations to improve confidence in science
through enhancing Reproducibility and Replicability. Often used interchangeably, these two terms are defined
precisely in the report. Reproducibility means obtaining consistent results through computation with the the same 
input data while replicability means obtaining consistent results across experiments with their own data.

The PyHC organization is directly aligned with their recommendation to "investing in research and development of open-source, 
usable tools and infrastructure that support reproducibility for a broad range of studies across 
different domains in a seamless fashion."

The study was produced by the Committee on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science and funded by
the National Science Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
