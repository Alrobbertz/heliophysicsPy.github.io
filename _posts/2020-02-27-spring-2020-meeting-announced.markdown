PyHC serves as a community knowledge base for performing heliophysics research in Python, aiming to provide a variety of tutorials, resources, a list of useful packages, general discussion, and advice. Twice yearly, PyHC meets in person. These meetings are open to anyone from individuals already utilizing Python heavily in developing open-source heliophysics packages, as well as those who are just getting into using Python and open source development. 

**PyHC's first meeting of 2020 will be held remotely during the time period of Monday, April 27th, 2020 - Wednesday, April 29th, 2020. Please fill out [this poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?8868649-hQWN1) by Friday, March 13th, 2020 to decide on times for the remote spring meeting. Note that the poll is in Mountain Time. The exact time and dates of the meeting will be announced once the poll is closed and responses are reviewed.** We’ll discuss PyHC Project updates, potentially have a guest speaker, as well as plans for the in-person Fall meeting.
The meeting's website can be found [here](http://heliopython.org/meetings/april2020/). **Registration, which is free, but required, can be found [here](https://forms.gle/fYxWXWccyTZxnVUH9).** The meeting's website also has a link to registration.
